To create a compelling audio visualizer in Blender, I rely on Eevee for its speed and suitability for motion graphics. Since the goal here is a polished, real-time animation, using Cycles would only slow down the process without adding significant visual benefits. With Bloom enabled, I start by adding a plane, subdividing it extensively, and applying a displacement modifier. This generates the dynamic waveform effect.
  

Setting up the camera at a focal length of 100 creates a flat, clean composition that fills the frame. For the shading, I work directly in the base settings without using HDRI. I set the world brightness to black and use a mix shader with an emission node for a glowing effect. To refine the look, I employ a wave texture combined with a color ramp to achieve crisp lines, adjusting settings to avoid muddy gradients.


To enhance the visual flow, I apply a gradient texture to fade one side of the lines, giving the composition a more polished appearance. The gradient, paired with a B-spline, allows for a soft transition that emphasizes the glowing foreground while fading out the background for depth.
  

When incorporating audio, I animate the displacement modifier using keyframe baking and fine-tune the waveformâ€™s behavior through graph editor adjustments. This ensures the animation remains visually consistent, even during intense sections of the audio.


For rendering, I apply RGB color schemes in the compositor to achieve vibrant, eye-catching results. Using an MP4 output via FFmpeg makes the process efficient, and setting the subdivision surface to a higher level ensures smooth animation. With these steps, I create visually striking audio visualizers that sync perfectly with any sound. This approach balances efficiency and aesthetics, producing high-quality animations quickly.
